Mini arcade games for Minecraft in a form of a plugin.
Quility of the code is shit, as I am fairly new to Java.
Wanna try it out or improve it? You are welcome to commit!

Using spigot-api-1.15.2-R0.1-SNAPSHOT

Commands:

/fort start -> Starts the "fort defense" minigame

/fort stop  -> Guess what? This stops it
